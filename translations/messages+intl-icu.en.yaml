about-us.heading: 'About RemedyMatch'
about-us.text: "RemedyMatch was created during the WirVsVirus hackathon, an initiative organized in cooperation with the German government between March 20-22, 2020. From over 1200 submissions RemedyMatch was selected as one of the top 20 projects. Just three days later, the platform alpha went live. Since then, an interdisciplinary expert team of more than 60 people has come together working on a voluntary basis to develop a scalable open-source donation and logistics platform. RemedyMatch aims to bring together inventory and demand for medical protective and emergency relief items quickly and easily, thereby helping to bridge supply bottlenecks during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond.\n"
